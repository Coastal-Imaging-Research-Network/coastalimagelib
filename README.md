# CoastalImageLib


CoastalImageLib  is  a  Python  library  that  produces  georectified  images as well as common coastal image products intended for quantitative analysis of  coastal  environments.   This  library  contains  functions  to  georectify  and merge  multiple  oblique  camera  views,  produce  statistical  image  products for  a  given  set  of  images,  as  well  create  subsampled  pixel  instruments  for use in bathymetric inversion, surface current, run-up calculations, and other quantitative analyses.  Additionally, this library contains support functions to DeBayer .raw sensor data collected from the Argus tower in Duck, NC,format camera intrinsic values, and convert extrinsic values from geographicalto user defined local coordinates.
