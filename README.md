# CoastalImageLib

CoastalImageLib is a Python library that produces georectified images as well as common coastal image products intended for quantitative analysis of coastal environments. This library contains functions to georectify and merge multiple oblique camera views, produce statistical image products for a given set of images, as well create subsampled pixel instruments for use in bathymetric inversion, surface current, run-up calculations, and other quantitative analyses. Additionally, this library contains support functions to format camera intrinsic values from various input file formats, convert extrinsic values from geographical to user defined local coordinates, and functions to interface with Argus software such as the Argus tower in Duck, NC and mini- Argus stations throughout the U.S.
